# Overview

VisionFit AI is a comprehensive nutrition and fitness application that combines artificial intelligence with computer vision for personalized health guidance. The system uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent workout plan generation and nutritional analysis, while MediaPipe provides real-time pose detection for exercise form analysis. The application supports food image analysis for calorie counting, AI-powered workout planning, and real-time exercise form tracking with feedback.

# Deployment Guide

## Railway Deployment

VisionFit AI is configured for easy deployment on Railway. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. **Create a Railway Account**
   - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app/) if you don't have an account

2. **Install Railway CLI** (Optional)
   - Install the Railway CLI for easier deployment: `npm i -g @railway/cli`
   - Login using: `railway login`

3. **Create a New Project**
   - From the Railway dashboard, click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select this repository

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In your Railway project, go to the "Variables" tab
   - Add the following environment variables:
     - `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string for session encryption
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Railway will automatically provide this for PostgreSQL
     - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
     - `PORT`: Railway will set this automatically

5. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
   - Click "+ New" and select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically link the database to your project

6. **Deploy Your Application**
   - Railway will automatically detect the Procfile and deploy using Gunicorn
   - The deployment will use the Python version specified in runtime.txt

7. **Access Your Application**
